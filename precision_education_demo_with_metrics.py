**Sepsis Management Summary**

In summary, immediate resuscitation with 30 mL/kg balanced crystalloids, early empiric antibiotics (within 1 hour for shock), dynamic monitoring of fluid responsiveness, and individualized MAP targets (potentially higher in elderly hypertensive patients with AKI) are the cornerstones of guideline-based sepsis management in the ICU. Ongoing assessment and adaptation of therapy are essential, particularly in complex scenarios involving advanced age, hypertension, and renal dysfunction.[1-4][6-8]
